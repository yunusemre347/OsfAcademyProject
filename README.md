# OsfAcademyProject
 yunus emre yÄ±lmaz academy project

this is the project assigned by osf academy.
this page has been created in the directions of the guide that has been provided to us. 

the project is responsive to mobile and pc screens but only in big desktop screens or small iphone screens.
so it lacks bootstrap like features and behave different in wrong screen sizes.

it also doesnt work well in google chrome but works perfectly in every other browser(firefox opera)(tbh idk why.)
